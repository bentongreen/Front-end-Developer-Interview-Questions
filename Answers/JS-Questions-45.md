* Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.

Synchronous functions have to wait for previous functions to finish before they run and likewise following functions cannot run until the current function finishs. Asynchronus function however can run in any order and can run at the same time so they aren't waiting on other functions to finish before they can run.
