* Describe the difference between a `cookie`, `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`.

local storage keeps information in the browser as long as the user doesn't delete it. Session storage however will only last until the session ends mean it is lost when the user closes the tab or browser they are in. Cookies store information and can transfer that information to the server (local and session storage do not transfer information to the server)
