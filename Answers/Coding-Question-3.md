*Question: What value is returned from the following statement?*
```javascript
"i'm a lasagna hog".split("").reverse().join("");
```

The string "goh angasal a m'i" is returned from the aformentioned statement. This happens because it first splits the string into an array of each individual character and then reverses the array and joins all the character strings back together in their present order.
