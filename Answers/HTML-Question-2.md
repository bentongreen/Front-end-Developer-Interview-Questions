* What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?

There are three modes used by web browsers now, quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode or just standards mode. In quirks mode you are basically telling the layout to emulate the nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and IE5 which allows for support of sites built pre adoption of web standards. In standards mode you are telling the browser behavior to be what is defined by the HTML and CSS specs.
